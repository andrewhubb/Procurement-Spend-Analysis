A Power BI Procurement Spend Analysis for WorldWide Importers.

This report uses the WorldWide Importers database from microsoft which can be downloaded from here: 

[https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0)

The report is intended to help the purchasing manager monitor expenditure 

The data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server the report can be refreshed from the Power BI Cloud Serice if you install a Power BI enterprise gateway.
The pbix uploaded to this repository requires a Direct Connection to SQL Server as the version with imported data was 185 Mb in size due to the number of transactions in the database. Github has a 25Mb limit so I created Direct Connection version to get around that problem as the filesize is now less than 1/2 a megabyte.
